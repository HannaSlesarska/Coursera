			Tender chicken breast coated in egg and breadcrumbs and sautéed in olive oil, served with mozzarella and Romano cheeses and covered in a rich tomato sauce. We serve our Chicken Parmigiana with a side of spaghetti for dinner. Try this classic pairing of Italian comfort foods that will leave you saying 'yum!' This is the classic version of Chicken Parm. A restaurant-quality Chicken Parmesan is so easy to recreate at home (for a fraction of the price). Since this chicken is breaded and covered in sauce, it also reheats really well so you will appreciate any leftovers. The Italian name is Chicken Parmigiana and in the US, it has been nicknamed Chicken Parm, short for Chicken Parmesan. It is essentially breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and cheese.How can something so simple be THIS good you ask?
